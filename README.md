# Running
Every task will contain the source code, if the source code use snippets from other proggrammer they will have the reference. In order to avoid problems with dependencies I'll suggest you use Virtualenv or the official python virtualenv(pipenv)
## Step 1. Install Anaconda with python 3.6

## step 2. Clone the Github repository 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/secano97/strongWeakPruning
$ cd strongWeakPruning
```
